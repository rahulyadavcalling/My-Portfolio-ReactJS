      Hey, My name is Reyansh Mishra, I am an Android and iOS Developer, previously I was working with Tacto Infomedia Pvt. Ltd. currently, I am freelancing. In my college days, I created an Android App called Boom because of which Ianded a job in my first company that is Tacto.

       When I was in final year of my graduation I had PPO from L&T Infotech and Infosys but I chose to work with a Startup because learning new skills and development work excites me more than working in an MNC. I am an Android enthusiast and have created a couple of open source projects on my GitHub profile.

       I started learning android when I had to create a project for my graduation and I learned android development from youtube and with the help of blogs and open source projects.

       My biggest inspiration is "Mr. Elon Musk" maybe I will get lucky someday and meet him.
      <br />
      <br />
       In my spare time, I either play a video game on my PlayStation 4 or use the internet. I donâ€™t like to study books so I use Quora to gain a little bit of knowledge, sometimes I write there but not much.
